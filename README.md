# jsifier

A utility for converting `package:js` objects to Maps and Lists

This *was* a workaround for [dart-lang/sdk issue #27079](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/27079)
but now can be used to convert opaque JS lists and maps.

Also exposes `JSON.stringify()` as `stringify()`

## Usage

see `test/jsifier_test.dart` for an example
